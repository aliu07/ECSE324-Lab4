# Conway's Game of Life
This project is inspired from British mathematician John Horton Conway's game of life. The repository features drivers for the VGA display fo the emulator as well as the PS/2 keyboard. The emulator can be accessed at the following link: https://ecse324.ece.mcgill.ca/simulator/?sys=arm-de1soc

## VGA Drivers
The VGA driver file, called vga.s, contains code that writes to the display of the emulator. To run the code and see its output, walk through the following steps:
1. Copy-paste the vga.s file contents into the emulator.
2. Click the compile button.

4. The output will be visible on the emulated VGA display. This display can be found on the right-hand side of the emulator UI where all the I/O devices are located.
